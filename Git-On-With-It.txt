Here's a random file i have created to practice using GitHub for source control

I'm guessing i'll need to add some further changes later, so i'll make a list of the planets below:

1. Mercury
2. Venus
3. Earth
4. Mars
5. Saturn
6. Pluto
7. Uranus
8. Jupiter
9. Moon
10. International Space Station

Sure i'll have missed a few and got them in a wrong order, this is my first attempt!

Done. Isaac.
